  social organization
    "hackers as anti-social loners who have deep relatonsips with their computer to the detriment of sociaal relationships"
    Best and Luckenbill (1982 ) state deviant relationships with one another can be placed on 
      Deviant peer associations
      shared deviance
      Division of labor  within the group
      Maintain their deviance for an extended time
    five point continuum of organizational sophistication
      Loners - least sophisticated
      colleagues - create a deviant subculture based on shared knowlege
      Peers - associate and participate in deviance together
      teams - offend for longer periods of time and have division of labor
      formal organizations - most sophistication
    based on this framework  hackers are no the oners and they often operater within social networks
      often hack in groups and learn from each other
      on and offline social ties b/w hackers enable info sharing
      envolved into a deviant communitty

  The hacker subculture

  tools of the trade
    anonymity
    encription
    steganography
    social engineering
  anonymous re-mailers
    definition a server which recives emails with embedded instructions on where to send them next so the server
        fowards the emails without reveaking their original source
      strips the sender's address and replaces it with pseudonym befor sending 
    do they protect our first amendment rights and right to privacy?
      yes
  anonymizor - a tool that attemps to make internet activity untracible 
    aka anonymizer proxy
    a proxy server that acts as a privacy sheild between your personal computer and the internet by stripping
        your ip address
  encription 
    definition- transforming information using an algorithm to make it unreadable to anyone without a key
      cryptography - science of writing in secret codes
      original intended tp be used by financial institutions to prevent the online theft of personal and confidential info
      proposed federal legislation for encryption keys to be discovered under court order
  steganography- the science of hiding information
    repalaces bits of useless pr unused data in regular computer files ( such as a graphic) with bits of different invisible infprmation
    what is the key difference between cryptography and steganography
      privacy vs secrecy
      illegible data vs hidden data
  social engineering
    definition - the art of getting access to or information from people or places that the social engineer should not be able to acess
      espionage
      intellectual property theft
    example of social engineering
  
  cyberterrism
    the term was first coined in the late 1980s
     the defence intelligance agency (DIA) stated a decade later that "cyber is no t a threat at least not yet"
     cybererwar, cyberterrism cybercrime and hackivism are often incorrectly uses synonymously which is why there 
        is no " one" definition for cyberterrorism
    cyber crime is a crime using the internet
    cyberwarefare - the use of computers and other electronic devices to attacl an enemys information systems
      uses tactics such as sabptage and espionage( security breaches)
    in the 1990s the main concern were that cyber terrorists would targer critical infrastructures
      electric power and water supplty systems
      penetrate national systems to launch nuclear wepons
      creating "doomsday" senerios
    in 1999 president clinton proposed a 40% increase in the budget to protect critical systems
    blaster.exe virus most damaging virusever worm

    us patrijot act 2001
      section 814
        deterrence and prevention pf cyberterrorism forbids unauthorized damage to a protected computer
      section 816 allows the attorney general to establish regional computer forensic laboratories
     there are some countries that controral the export adn import of cryptography( china vietnam
     inciting violence or promoting raceism online is illegal in some countries as well (canada)

    computer employee abuse
        orginzation insiders texh speca;ists as well as all other employees with access to the information systems and resources in the fulfillment of organizationsal reponsiblilities but intentionally exceed or misuse that access in a manner that negativily
    insider crimes  
        insider it sabotage
        Insider theft of intellectual property
        Insider fraud

        insider it sabotage
            an insiders use of it to direct specific harm at an organization pr an individual

                    for personal gain or theft of information which leads to fraud ( identity theft)
    over view of insider abuse 
        according to the computer security institut insiders accounted for 16% of attacks and 25% of responding businesses indicated that they had experienced insider abuse of internet access or email in 2010
    behavioral information security 
        BIS - the area of information security research that deals with the abuse behavior of insiders
        Bis views insiders as the :weakest link" in an organization security chain and are viewed as security threats
        many organizations hace sought to deter computer abuse by employing the tenets of general deterrence theory(GDT)
        * Orginzation adhering to a GDT view employeed as a rish and seek to limit insiders damage by applying sanctions 
        * certa
    Motivation for study 
        biggest motivaion for computer abuse is retaliation and ager and the greatest deterrent is sanction
        based on this berns et al conducted a study that incoperated both incentives and disincentives of security related intentions and or ehaviors into single research modles

        retaliation and anger and job condiions job iduced tension or stress might be a result of any of a number of stimuli such as abuse supervision incivility in the workspace or perceptions of injustace
                amoung other
        thers jpb cpnditions can result in anger and desires for retaliation which have been shown to lead to deviant or sabotage behavior
        in a tech enabled workspace such desires for retaliation have been shown to be manifested through acts of computer abuse
        
        personal rewards 
            behaviors that recive positive reinforcment is more likly to reoccur than negative reinforcment 
            extrinsic ( ie financial) rewards make it possible for people to act contrary to their usual behavior
                individual with strong moral convictions less likely ot engage in insider abuse despite finantil rewards

            case studys have found that insiders are suscepatible to financial rewards form third parties seeking some benefir from intentional ,isuse of information resources and systems
        personal factors 
        negative affect ( a genaral dimension of subkective distress materialized in aversive mood states such as anger guil fear and nervousness ) has been show to be related to sounterproductive work behaviors
        the role of personally derived learning behaviors sich as the motivationsal impact of curiosity has ben of interest in organizational behavior
        perosnal factors such as negative affesct and personal curiosity are supported by the literature as potentaially increasing computer abuse

        finding from research 
            personal idelogy ( aka good moral) is the most thing that prevents a person to abuse 
            unhappy people are causing 

            sanctions are the most reported reaseon but personal moral values is the second reason to not cause abuse



Internet child pornography
    child porn in the preinternet
    invention of the camera in 1824 
    child pron isnt new
    pedophiles were the main prducers ( cotage industry)
    ten year madness of 1969 - 1979
        demark legalized child porn
        sexual revolution in the us
        changed from cottage to commercial industry
        chapter 6 in book
    1980 denmark criminalized CP production 
        changed back to a cottage industry
    CP morphed again to a cermertial proble with the internet
    20% of all pornography avaiable via the Internet contains children 
    More consumers of CP than child sex offenders
    
    the united states attempts at regulating the internet child porn industry through lgislation have contuisly clashed 
        with the first amendment (freedom of speech and expression)
        fourth amendment (protection against unlawful search and seizure)
    obscene - illegal expressions of speech
    indecent - protected expressions of sppeech under the first admendment

    Protection of Children against sexual exploitation act(1978)
        Prohibited the production or commercial distribution of obscene materials depicting minors under the age of 16 years
        Prevention of child sex abuse > First amendment right 
    chid protection act of 1984
        redefined "sexual conduct and minor" ( under the age of 18 years)
        child pornography did not havve to involve "obscene" behavior ( sexual activity) but may include visual descriptions of non-obscene behavior(clothed genitall region)
        criminal individuals who produced or trafficked non- commercial child porn ( withour finacial motives)
    Child porn and obscenity enforcment in 1988

    child porn protection act(1996)
        virtual child porn
        images of a minor what was created through the use of tech rather than the actual explotation of a real victim
        congress stated it " inflames the desire of child milesters pedophiles and child porn"

    Ashcraft vs Free Speech Coalition (2002)
        "appears t obe" and " conveyed the impression " violated constitutional rights ( too broad and vague)
        Protected under First Amendment because Ferber defined CP as obscene to protect children from sexual abuse

    Protect act of 2003
        courts burdened with providing the images were of real children and not virtual children 
        persons who appear virtually indistinguishable from actual minors
        burden of proof shifted to the Defence

    Protect Our children act of 2008
        created new offense " morphed" child porn
        non pron images of real children modification or changed to create child porn

    summery
        "criminalizes the possession distrabution and production of sexual explicit images of individuals ( actual or indistinguishable from ) under the age of 18 years"
