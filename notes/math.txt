  graph theory
    order and dependancies
    vertex node } and { edges
      vertx are points and edges are the lines
      V = collection of verticies 
      E = edges 
    relation : incidence 
      edge g is incident on u and x
        h     "     on v and x
        i     "     on w and x
        f     "     on v and w
        e     "     on u and v
            } gives g
        can be drawn differently 
      isomorphic

      def Vi and Vj are adjacent if there is an edge incident on both vi and vj 
        v and w are adjecent
        u and w are not
      loop an edge that begains and ends at the same place
        not ok are a edge without two vertexi

      ok: a vertex that has no incident edge is isolated
      
      def given 
        g = {V,E}
        G' = {V',E'}
      G and G' are isomorphic provided : there is a function
        f: V -> V' one to one and onto
        and a function 
          g: E->E' one to one and onto
        and so that for every v in V and e in E
        v and e are incident if and only if f(v) and g(e) are incident
      def a graph G is simple if there are no parallel edges and no loops
    pattern how mant edges can there be in a simple graph with n verticies
      max edges (n(n-1))/2

    a simple graph where every pair of vertices is adjacen t is said to be complete
      K_4 notation
    bipartite graph is one where the set of vertices V = V_1 u V_2 V_1 \cup V_2
      so no two verticies in V_1 are adjacent and likewise for V_2
      

notes
  isomorphic trees
  PERT
  if a tree has n vertices then it has n-1 edges
